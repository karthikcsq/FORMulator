## FORMulator
FORMulator is a program to help anyone perfect a movement, from everything from a Tiktok dance to a three point shot's form. The program will tell you if you make an incorrect movmement or your timing is off.

## Usage
Simply head to our website (as of now, it is a local host, but it will be uploaded). Simply input a video of the form you want to perfect, and then input a video of your attempt to recreate that movement.
