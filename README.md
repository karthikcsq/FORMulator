## FORMulator
FORMulator is a program to help anyone perfect a movement, from everything from a Tiktok dance to a three point shot's form. The program will tell you if you make an incorrect movmement or your timing is off.

## Usage
You can evaluate your movements in real-time against a video input at `web_app.py`, and simply running it. If you would prefer to evaluate two videos, run `web_app2.py`.
